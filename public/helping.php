        <h2><a name="volunteering">How to Volunteer</a></h2>
        <h3>Saturday Morning Volunteers</h3>
        <p>
          Adult volunteers are needed on Saturday mornings from 8 to 11:30 AM
          to escort clients through the pantry to shop. Youth volunteers (grade
          6 and above) are needed to help clients carry bags for donors and
          clients.  Saturday volunteers work one Saturday a month. To volunteer,
          contact pantry's Volunteer Coordinator, Debbie, at 781-769-5650.
        </p>

        <h3>Thursday Morning Sorting</h3>
        <p>
          The Pantry is open for sorting and stocking food supplies at 8:30
          AM on Thursdays. Just drop by, no need to call. Wear casual,
          comfortable clothing and shoes. Occasionally, when there have been
          very large food drives, we need volunteers on other days, as
          well. Announcements will be posted in the News and Events section on
          our homepage.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Volunteer Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
          Have a special talent or interest? The Pantry is an
          all-volunteer organization with a wide variety of volunteer
          needs.  For example, we often need drivers to move food from
          one location to another. <span class="internal-note">What other
          examples?</span> If you belong to one of the congregations
          represented on our board, speak to your congregational
          representative or find out more from Ruth Taeger at
          781-769-0425.
